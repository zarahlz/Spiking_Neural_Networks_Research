# Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) Research Plan

This repository contains a structured research plan for the Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) research team.

**Phase 1: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks**

This section includes summaries of Deep Learning and Computational Neuroscience tutorials and courses.

**Phase 2: Introduction to Spiking Neural Networks**

This section contains summaries on biological principles such as spiking behavior, membrane potential, and the Izhikevich model. It also includes simulation of basic neuron models, spike rate coding vs. temporal coding, and learning mechanisms such as STDP.

**Phase 3: Independent Simulation Work**

This section includes independent experiments by choosing and customizing neuron models, adjusting parameters, and reviewing research papers to deepen understanding and contribute to SNN modeling.
