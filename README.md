# Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) Research Plan

This repository contains a structured research plan for the Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) research team. It is designed to guide learners from foundational concepts in artificial neural networks (ANNs) to advanced topics in spiking neural networks and independent simulation work.

**Phase 1: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks**

Build a strong foundation in neuroscience and ANN fundamentals with curated tutorials and courses, including deep learning concepts and biological inspirations.

**Phase 2: Introduction to Spiking Neural Networks**

Gain hands-on experience with SNN models, spike encoding methods, and neuron dynamics. Study biological principles such as spiking behavior and membrane potential, explore neuron models like Izhikevich, and implement simulations for learning mechanisms such as STDP.

**Phase 3: Independent Simulation Work**

Conduct independent experiments by choosing and customizing neuron models, adjusting parameters, and reviewing research papers to deepen understanding and contribute to SNN modeling.

This plan includes essential resources, code examples, and simulation exercises to support a comprehensive learning journey into spiking neural networks.
