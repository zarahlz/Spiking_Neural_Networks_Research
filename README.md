# Spiking_Neural_Networks_Research
This repository contains a structured research plan for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), including study materials on Artificial Neural Networks, biological neuron models, spike encoding, neuron simulations (LIF, Hodgkin-Huxley, Izhikevich), synaptic plasticity (STDP), and SNN projects for hands-on exploration.
